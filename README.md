# Aria-CVision
Most of what remains of my capstone project work done for SUNY Polytechnic Institute


Missing some files due to github's sync limit making me accidentally delete my local copies like the language model and voice.h
but those files should still be on my login for sunyit.edu email but I can't access the email anymore to reset my password.
^^whole process of getting access to email will most likely be not worth showing the 4 lines of voice.h and the custom.dict file.
